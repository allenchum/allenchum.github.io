Hi, I am Allen.
I am an illustrator
also
a Web Developer.


When I was child, I told my mum I want to be a scientist.
I was in love with Math and Science.
I always curious how to make things work, and study knowledge behind them.


Like all other teenage boys, I was in love with animation too.
I started sketching characters since I was 10.
Sketching is a language to me, expressing myself in graphical way. 


Web Developing is a great combination of
Technology and Design. 
We make contents simple, interactive and easy to read.
