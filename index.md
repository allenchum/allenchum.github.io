## Welcome to My Pages

I am Allen. Nice to meet you!

This is my first time to use GitHub to write a page in Markdown langauge. 


### Markdown

They said Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax.   
Is it true? Let's check it out!

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

```

I just notice that we can use emoji in Markdown. Let's try it!  
* this is a camel. :camel:
* this is a crown. :crown:
* this is a sun. :sunny:
* this is a moon. :full_moon:

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chumwai217/allenchum.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
